# Space-Mathematics

This game is designed to teach primary school children mathematical concepts in a didactic and accessible way. Through interactive and fun dynamics, children can learn and practice different math topics, which facilitates the assimilation of knowledge.

The game was developed using Unity, which allowed us to create an attractive and immersive visual experience for the users.

In addition, we have implemented a complementary website that allows us to visualize the students' statistics. This site makes use of a SQLite database to store and manage student performance information. Through this system, educators can easily access the data to evaluate each child's progress and adapt educational activities as needed.

For the creation of the website, we used modern web technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These tools allowed us to design an intuitive and responsive interface, facilitating user interaction. We also implemented the use of APIs to integrate different functionalities and improve the user experience on the site.

This project not only seeks to improve children's math skills, but also to foster a fun and accessible learning environment, adapted to the needs of elementary school students.
